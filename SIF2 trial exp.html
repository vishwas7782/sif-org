                <div id="aboutfounderpara" class="founderpara">
                    <p>Our founder is Evg Ashok Kumar Gupta. He was born and brought-up in a small village of Bihar,
                        Karnaul Garh- a village in Sahebganj block of Muzaffarpur district, Bihar. He has done his
                        education in Assam. He was doing a running his own business and their after a job when God
                        called him for hi full time ministry in the year 2007. From the 2007 to the year 2015 he and his
                        family did the service of God in Motipur. In the year 2005 God lead them to their native place,
                        Sahebganj, for the ministry and they mod=ved to Sahebganj. Now he Kumar and his family are
                        staying at Sahebganj and serving the Lord with whole family. Evg. Ashok Kumar had a desire to
                        open a free school for the ragpicker children. Whenver he used to see them picking rags for
                        their survival, he felt very bad for them. When he talked to them some of them told their they
                        don't have father, some told that they don't have their mother. That's why they are doing this
                        for their survival because no one is there to look after them and if they will not do this then
                        they will not get food. They picks the rags fromn the heap of garbages. They usually jump into
                        the garbage heap and then picks some items which can be sold to some junk stores. They barely
                        gets the money sufficient for the food. Sometimes they need to beg for getting food. When Evg
                        Ashok Kumar show this, he felt very bad for them and started to pray for them continuously. He
                        has burden to start a school for them. So, that they can have a better future. This became the
                        base for the Shalom India Foundation. While working for these children we need to provide
                        education to them, financial support to their family so that they will not send them to do the
                        old work again.

            <p id="Vision1para" class="Visionspara">We here at <strong>Shalom
                    India Foundation</strong> works for the betterment of the human life. Today when we look
                around
                in our society we find a huge number of children who are not getting proper education,
                proper
                healthcare facilities, proper food, clothes and many other basic things necessary for every
                human
                being. We at Salom India Foundation try to show some love to the children who lack this
                facilities,
                as our Christ loved us, we spread His love to others. We know that we being a small
                foundation,and
                we are also a human being, can't change the life of everyone. But, if our small step brings
                happiness in the life of even one chil or one family, we will be more than happy to do this.
                <strong> In our own country India, at least 15 crore children and youths are out of the
                    country's
                    formal education system, and roughly about 25 crore population is below the primary
                    definition
                    of literacy. Over 53% children in India under five years - that is, 67 million - live
                    without
                    basic healthcare facilities. Aabout 53 per cent of children in India are not growing
                    well
                    which
